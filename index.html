      <h2>Lionel Messi Early Days</h2>
      <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi and his wife
        Celia Cuccittini.</p>
      <p>A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the
        six years he played for Newell's, he scored 234 goals in 176 games (according to Rosario Football Association).
      </p>
      <p>As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September
        2000. First team director Carles Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at
        the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December,
        an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand,
        offered a contract on a paper napkin.</p>

      <h2>Lionel Messi Barcelona Days</h2>
      <p>Messi signed his first professional contract on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an
        initial buyout clause of €30 million.</p>
      <p>After being called up to the senior team, Messi made his first appearance in an official match on October 16,
        2004, against Espanyol in La Liga, coming on the field in the 82′ minute.</p>
      <p>Messi scored his first goal on May 1, 2005, against Albacete, assisted by Ronaldinho, becoming the youngest
        ever goalscorer for the club at that time.</p>
      <p>Messi won his first La Liga trophy on the season 2004/05. Messi played in 7 games that season all as subtitute,
        scoring 1 goal.</p>

      <h2>Lionel Messi For Argentina</h2>
      <p>Messi made his first-team international debut in August 2005, during a friendly game against Hungary. Messi was
        sent off just one minute after he entered the field. There are still debates on whether he actually deserved the
        red card.</p>
      <p>In his sixth appearance with national team, Messi scored his first international goal in a friendly game
        against Croatia.</p>
